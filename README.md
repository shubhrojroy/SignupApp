# SignupApp

Enterprise event management application developed to event committe to manage signups for events organized by them. 

The application enables the employees to login using employee credentials and then signup and checkin for events that are currently being organized. It also enables event owners to get the total attended count for that event and also download this list of employees who attended the event which may be used for documentation / billing purposes. 

The application is cross-platform enabling users to login from any mobile device. It also handles concurrent checkin and updates. The application code is mostly in JavaScript and php. It is developed using Sencha Touch framework.
